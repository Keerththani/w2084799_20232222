                <p>Biodiversity, or biological diversity, is the variety of life forms within a given ecosystem, biome, or on the entire Earth. Terrestrial ecosystems are made up of many different habitats or geographical areas, dominated by specific kinds of plants and other organisms. These include forests, grasslands, deserts, and tundras. Each habitat has certain species of plants and animals that are best adapted to grow there. The variety of life found in an area contributes to its biodiversity. High levels of biodiversity are found wherever conditions are most favorable for sustaining species-rich communities. Biodiversity in terrestrial ecosystems provides many direct and indirect economic benefits to human society by: <p>(a) maintaining environmental sustainability - high species diversity is essential for the long term maintenance of natural landscapes that have not been strongly affected by human development;</p><p> (b) providing ecosystem services - ecosystems provide a wide range of services that have an impact on human quality of life including air and water purification, soil fertility, climate regulation and waste recycling; such as diseases;</p><p> (d) supporting food webs - various plant species in all terrestrial ecosystems both support herbivores directly and also provide habitats for insects etc.; thus they support biodiversity at higher levels of feeding.</p></p>

                <p>But human activities, including deforestation, encroachment on wildlife habitats, and increasingly intensive agriculture, are pushing terrestrial ecosystems to the brink. Prominent among the many ways in which are destroying nature is habitat loss and fragmentation. Essentially we are reducing the amount of space available for species to live in and creating barriers that make it difficult for them to move around. When species are cut off from each other, they can’t access different sources of food or mates or find new places to live or hide from predators. In addition, pollution (including global warming), increased movement of alien invasive species around the planet and over exploiting the few remaining resources accelerate these negative impacts on species and ecosystems. Thousands of known species as well probably even more thousands of yet unknown ones have been lost from deforestation alone in Amazonia for example where both agriculture and cattle ranching continue to expand.</p>

                <p>Efforts to preserve and protect biodiversity on land are fundamental to maintaining healthy ecosystems. Protected areas, such as national parks and wildlife refuges, are designed to safeguard the most intact habitats as well as the plants and animals that depend on them. Sustainable land-use practices, such as agroforestry and reforestation, also help buffer against the impacts of human use. International agreements, like the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), and global goals for sustainable development, such as the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), work to promote the conservation of biodiversity and ensure its sustainable use. Public education and involvement are also necessary components of any successful effort toward preservation. By recognizing that biodiversity has intrinsic value as part of our world and by understanding its indirect contributions to our lives—such as through ecosystem services—we can make informed decisions about how to better protect it.</p>
